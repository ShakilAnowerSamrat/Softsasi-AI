This way we have designed the game. Now let’s move on to the
methodology part.
Methodology:
The team followed a systematic and iterative approach to develop the
Visual AI Assistant. This included conceptualizing, developing, testing, and evaluating the assistant. The team used Unreal Engine 5 as the game
engine, Blueprint as the visual scripting system, OpenAI api as the
artificial intelligence platform, and C++ and JavaScript for programming. Conceptualization: The team began by conceptualizing the assistant, discussing ideas for the assistant’s functionality, graphics, and
interaction. The team also researched similar assistants and
identified what features they wanted to include in “Softsasi AI” and
what features they wanted to avoid. Development: Once the concept was finalized, the team began the
development process. This included creating the assistant’s world, designing and implementing the assistant’s functionality, graphics, and
interaction. Here are some glimpse of Blueprint and C++ program:

Testing: The team tested the assistant using various tools and
methods such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, usability testing, etc. The team also debugged and fixed any errors or
bugs that they encountered during the development process. Evaluation: The team evaluated the performance and quality of the
assistant using various criteria such as functionality, usability, reliability, efficiency, maintainability, portability, etc. The team also
collected feedback and suggestions from users and instructors using
online surveys and interviews. The team also analyzed the results
and findings from the testing and evaluation phase and made some
improvements and modifications to the assistant based on them.
The development process was not linear or sequential but rather
iterative and incremental. The team revisited and revised each phase
multiple times based on the feedback, suggestions, results, findings, challenges, difficulties, etc. that they encountered during the
development process. The team also communicated and
collaborated with each other regularly using online platforms such as
Discord, Zoom, and Slack to share their progress, problems, solutions,
ideas, etc. The development process was challenging but rewarding for the
team. The team learned new skills and knowledge in programming, game development, artificial intelligence, project management, etc. The team also experienced teamwork, creativity, innovation, problem-solving, etc. The team also enjoyed working on the project
and creating a Visual AI Assistant that can help users with various
tasks and queries using natural language and high-quality graphics. Result
